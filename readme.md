## Setup

To use a React Application as a chrome extension, you need to `npm run build` the application and then point to the `build` directory when you load the extension in Chrome.

Unfortunately, this is a bit of a hack. 

I'd say switch to Vite and remove tailwind to make development faster and easier.

But who really knows? 

Maybe by the time someone uses this, chrome will be divested from Google and we'll all be using Opera GX?
